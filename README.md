# BrusselatorModel

This repository contains code and results related to the simulation of the Brusselator Model for Physics of Complex Systems in the University of Granada.

The file GenerationBrusselator.py contains the code to generate the simulation and the animations.

The file Graphs.py allowed us to represent $Re(\sigma_q^+)$ vs $q$. This graphs allowed us to predict the behaviour of the system.

We will analyze the evolution of $x$, but studying $y$ would be equivalent.
