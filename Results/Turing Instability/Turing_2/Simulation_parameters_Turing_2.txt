The name of the files has the format brusseltor_{instability}_{b_c}_{a}_{d_X}_{d_Y}_{b}

Where b_c is the value of the b critical, and a, d_X, d_Y, b the value of the parameters taken in the simulation

Simulation corresponding to the parameters:

L = 50          # Size of the domain
N = 50         # Number of points in X
dx = L / N
dy = dx
dt = 0.01       # Time step
