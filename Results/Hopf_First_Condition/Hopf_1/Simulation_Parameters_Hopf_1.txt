Simulation corresponding to the parameters:

a = 2
dX = 1
dY = 2

L = 100          # Size of the domain
N = 100         # Number of points in X
dx = L / N
dy = dx
dt = 0.01       # Time step

We take the values of the bifurcation parameter:
b = 0.8b_c < b_c
b = 5 = b_c 
b = 1.2b_c > b_c
