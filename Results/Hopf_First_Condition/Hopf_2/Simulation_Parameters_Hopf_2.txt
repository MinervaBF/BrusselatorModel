Simulation corresponding to the parameters:

a = 1.5
dX = 10
dY = 15

L = 50          # Size of the domain
N = 50         # Number of points in X
dx = L / N
dy = dx
dt = 0.01       # Time step
T = 40          # Total Time

We take the values of the bifurcation parameter:
b = 3 = 0.9b_c < b_c
b = b_c = 3.25
b = 6.5 = 2b_c > b_c
